                <h3>Var,let and const are used to declare variables (introduced in ES6 - let and const) with different scope and behaviors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Var: Variables declared with var can be accessed all over the function. Regardless of where it is declared, it is hoisted to the top of the function.Can be redeclared within the same function</li>
                    
                    <li>Let: Variables declared with let are only accessible within the block they are declared in, but can't be redeclared within the same block.No hoisting take place here.</li>
                    
                    <li>Const: Const variable have a block scope just like 'let'. No hoisting ,reassignment and redeclaration take place in 'const' variables .</li>

              <ul>

                <li>Key characteristics of REST API: Resource-based, client-server architecture, stateless,cacheable, uniform interface, layered system</li>
                <li>REST APIs typically use HTTP methods to interact with resources: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE</li>
